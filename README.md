# Linux-GUI-Packages-Backup-Tool
<b>A little GUI made in bash + zenity, to bakup packages</b>

This script ignores missing packages (if you got a newer version of your distributions for example), so some packages can be missing in the end.

If zenity isn't installed you can do :


<b>sudo apt install zenity</b>


(Note that this command will only work for Linux distributions that use APT, like Debian, Ubuntu, PopOS!, ...)
